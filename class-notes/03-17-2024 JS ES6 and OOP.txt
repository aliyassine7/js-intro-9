Destructuring: is a helpful feature to get some elements or properties from arrays or objects.

Array Destructuring:

const arr = ['Biking', 'Coding', 'Reading', 'PS5'];

const fav1Act = arr[0];
const fav2Act = arr[1];
const fav3Act = arr[2];
const fav4Act = arr[3];

// Destructuring
const [fav1Act, fav2Act, fav3Act, fav4Act] = arr;

// Skip some elements in the middle
const [fav1Act, , , fav4Act] = arr;
